Hello Github! I am super excited to get started in my potential career in coding. I am starting my first semseter of coding. But let me tell you a little more about myself- I am 20 years old. I am currently a bartneder and server at a sports pub, 4 days a week, and going to school the other 3. I am beginning my new journey in getting my own first apartment, and plan on finalizing things, this week, if all goes to plan- tomorrow. I can't wait to begin my new life. I am looking forward to what all the future has in store. I also just offically began a new realtionship. I am so excitied to see where life's new journeys have in store for me. Can't wait to keep the work grind going... see you again soon.
